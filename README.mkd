# JavaScript Short Stories

This, as well as all the other _Short Stories_ repos in this
community, is a collection of short stories written in programming
languages, in this case: JavaScript.

To excecute any of the short stories, simply run them with `node`. For
example:

    node space_voyage.js

The stories are fully described inside the source code, the logs and
the output hopefully one day will resemble a humanly written story.
